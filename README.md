# Generic Collection

This package provides a generic collection type in Go that can store any type of value. It provides methods to add, remove, and find elements in the collection. The package also includes some useful methods to perform common operations on collections such as filtering, grouping, and selecting elements.

# Creating a Generic Collection

To create a new Generic Collection, you can call the NewGenericCollection function and pass in the initial values as a variadic argument:

```go
collection := NewGenericCollection(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
